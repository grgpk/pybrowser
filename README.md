# PyBrowser

A web browser implementation in Python based on the book "Web Browser Engineering" by Pavel Panchekha and Chris Harrelson.

## Overview

This project is a hands-on implementation following the "Web Browser Engineering" book to understand how web browsers work from the ground up. By building a browser from scratch, this project aims to provide deep insights into:

- HTML parsing and rendering
- CSS styling and layout
- JavaScript execution
- HTTP networking
- Browser security models
- And more core browser technologies

## Project Structure

As the project evolves, the browser will be built incrementally, following the book's chapter structure:

1. **URL Fetching and Display** - Basic URL handling and content display
2. **Drawing to the Screen** - Rendering text and basic layout
3. **Formatting Text** - Text flow and inline layout algorithms
4. **Constructing the Document Tree** - HTML parsing and DOM construction
5. **Laying Out Pages** - CSS box model and layout algorithms
6. **Applying Styles** - CSS parsing and style application
7. **Handling Buttons and Links** - Basic interactivity
8. **Running JavaScript** - JavaScript execution environment
9. **Handling Events** - Event handling and propagation
10. **Keeping Data Private** - Browser security model implementation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Required Python libraries (to be added as development progresses)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/grgpk/pybrowser.git
cd pybrowser
```

2. Set up a virtual environment (recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies (as they're added):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt  # Will be added as development progresses
```

### Running the Browser

Instructions for running the browser will be added as the project develops.

## Development Roadmap

The project will follow the book's progression, with each major feature corresponding to chapters from "Web Browser Engineering".
